PET/CBM Editor ROM Project - Development Notes
==============================================

This document is for adding notes, info, observations etc during development.


Introduction
------------

The Editor ROM on PET/CBM machines is a ROM chip that is part of the overall firmware of
the machine. It works along side the KERNAL and BASIC ROMs. The purpose of the Editor ROM
is to consolodate all code that is customized for the hardware. In this way Commodore could
sell different versions in different markets.

The Editor ROM controls all screen editing, screen output, keyboard input, and IRQ handling,
including clock updating. It contains tables to initialize the CRTC (screen) controller as
well as the keyboard matrix.  

The Editor ROM is mapped into the CPU address space from $E000 to $EFFF, however there is
an area from $E800-$E8FF that is used for I/O chips. Early Editor ROMs were 2KB in size
from $E000 to $E7FF. Later ROMs, usually international versions (French, DIN etc) were
4K in size from $E000 to $EFFF with the ROM at the IO range inaccessable to the cpu.

The KERNAL and BASIC directly call code in the Editor ROM at 5 fixed locations, so these
entry points must be preserved. Strangely, there is a JUMP TABLE starting at $E000 but
it is not used by the KERNAL or BASIC, but could be used by user-written software.


Zero-page usage
---------------

BASIC, EDITOR, and KERNAL use almost every byte of zero page for themselves. However, there
is a difference in usage for 40-column vs 80-column Editor ROMs. The 40-column ROM has
a feature called Line Linking. This is how the editor code tracks which lines should be
treated as 40 column (single) or 80-column (double/linked). For example if you type or print
on a line it will start as a 40-column line. The moment you type on the 40th column the
cursor will wrap to the next line and now the two lines are linked. They are treated as a
virtual 80-column line. You can see this by filling up both lines then moving back to the
first line and deleting characters. Characters from the second line will be pulled up to the
first line.
