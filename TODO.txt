PET/CBM EDIT ROM PROJECT - TODO List
========================

- The 324243-04 ROM appears to bypass the old screen line address tables, and instead calculates the screen pointer,
  and only supports 80-column screen.
- We will have to re-instate those tables in order to support soft-switched Soft-40!!!!
- Continue to add memory variable descriptions (see Commodore's CBM-II source for 'official' labels)
- Analyze extended keyboard scanning routine. Have special codes been modified?
- Document added screen codes for character set switching
- Update extended keyboard matrix tables
	- SHIFT tables need fixing (except for DIN, which is the template)
	- Look into C64 table
	- Do we need to add additional tables for "C=" (Commodore Key)?
- Comment Autoboot code, and convert to proper syntax
	- Do we want to include the "OLD" routine? (we already have the "OLD" matrix files)
- Add code from 40 column edit roms. Currently if you set COLUMNS=40 it uses the 80 column rom code.
	- 80 Column rom has no code for screen line linking. This restricts basic lines to one screen line.
	- Caution - screen line linking memory locations might be in use.
- ColourPET features:
	- Fix cursor changing colour of existing text when cursoring around
	- Some ESC codes not working.
	- Some C128 colour codes conflict with PET/CBM codes (ie: SHIFT-ESC)
	- BASIC lines with embedded colour codes cause the colour to change when the program is listed.
	- ColourPET uses ZP variables in TAPE area. Do not use TAPE with ColourPET or find alternate storage locations.
	- ColourPET hardware needs fixing!
- CBM-II keyboard support will require hardware modification.
- Sort out DIN keyboard matrix variations.
- Look into C64/VIC keyboard scanning routines. Can they be used in PET (allow support for NORMAL,SHIFTED,CTRL and C= keys)

- Investigate CRTC parameters for use with RGB/CGA to VGA adapters. Hervé connected his PET to a
  GB8220 board and says the sync width needs adjusting to get a stable picture. His 8032 CRTC
  is initialized with the following registers: 63,40,53,33,33,7,25,32,0,8

	
NOTE: If you are running ColourPET under VICE, please update to the latest experimental release!
      Colour RAM has been relocated to $8800 and hardware will be updated so that 40/80 columns
      can be supported with fixed colour ram locations
