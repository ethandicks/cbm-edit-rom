PET/CBM EDIT ROM PROJECT - TODO List
========================

- Continue to add memory variable descriptions (see Commodore's CBM-II source for 'official' labels)
- Find all screen writes and add code to handle colour
- Analyze extended keyboard scanning routine
	- Have special codes been modified?
- Document added screen codes for character set switching
- Update extended keyboard matrix tables
	- SHIFT tables need fixing (except for DIN, which is the template)
	- Look into C64 table
	- Do we need to add additional tables for "C=" (Commodore Key)?
- Comment Execudesk code, and convert to proper syntax
- Comment Autoboot code, and convert to proper syntax
- Figure out where to add code for ColourPET
	- Check for codes like {BLACK}, {WHITE} etc
- Decide if we want to break out the keyboard scanning routine.
	- Do we want to include the "OLD" routine? (we already have the "OLD" matrix files)
- Add keyboard reboot codes for other keyboard types B, DIN, C64
	- Determine if code will interfere with existing keyboardscanner.
